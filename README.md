# VaR Analysis For SP500
I found that the VaR breaches are usually followed by a significant drop of SP500, but the trend is present until 2016. See the jupyter notebook for details.

For some strange reasons, the plots in part (c) are not shown properly in my notebook. Therefore, I attach the two pictures down below:
